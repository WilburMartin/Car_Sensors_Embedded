# Getting Started

To get started with the bike sensor, just take the sensor, mount it on the front of the bike facing forwards, and connect it to a power supply- a phone, or a battery will do. Next, load the app on your phone, and let it run in the background. The sensor will now work automatically, and ring the bell anytime you approach another person, biker, or object.


#Settings

Statistics as to your distance from any objects in front of you in ft and seconds and your speed is displayed on the main page of the app, accessed by simply pressing "connect" on the front page. You can set the minimum speed at which you would like the bike to be running for it to ring, as well as the distance from the other bikers you'd like it to ring at, in the advanced page accessible using the button from the main page.


#Notes


Make sure the sensor is correctly oriented! The accelerometer is included for the specific purpose of making sure it is!
