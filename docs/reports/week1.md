Progress Made:


* I designed the WebUI and made it so that it could be updated through the particle cloud with information from the particle.
* I ported the WebUI to mobile and made sure that that works as well
* I set up all the particle cloud communication.


Problems and Potential Concerns


* I had to push the hardware work to this coming week because the items are stuck in the mail (Ugh). Going to have to reorder some stuff and send it to my home address so I can work on it at home. It's a good thing they only cost $7-ish total, shipping included.
* The position sensor documentation scares me
* I'm worried that the accelerometer isn't accurate enough to calculate speed. May have to do something else. 


Priorities for Next week
* Get the Piezzo Buzzer and Accelerometer working. I already know how both work from previous experience, so this shouldn't be an issue.
* Have the Accelerometer data get sent to the Particle.
* Have the particle be able to make calls to the Piezzo buzzer as needed
* Gain some understanding on how the position sensor works.
